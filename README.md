# Exploratory Statistics in Racket of Number of car crashes in Mexico City
For the Final project,  we want to write a program in Racket that can open a .csv file, read its contents and process the data inside.
The program recieves a csv file, reads it line per line, chooses only one column and stores it in a list. From that list, the program then sorts the list so it is in order, and then gets how many different elements are in the list and counts it.
